# Dataset information


## Chosen dataset: ***dataset1***


```python
import pandas
```


```python
# You will now proceed with a serious of commands in the next cell(s) that demonstrate some level of manipulation of the dataset that you are interested, in my case dataset1

# As you enter and execute commands leave the outputs so that I can read the manipulation that you did. Use all of your python skills here that you wish

# As an example I am providing some commands that have absolutly nothing to do with a dataset but just to illustrate the capture in my Jupyter notebook

# Once done, you can save this Jupyter notebook as a markdown and this is what I want you to commit to your private repo. Once you have your assignment ready, invite me to your private repo
